### Step-by-step analysis

1. **Understanding**: The intern initially misunderstood the question. The task was to capture the SQL command executed by `df.to_sql()` using `method='multi'`. The intern's first response incorrectly suggested using the `sqlite_master` table to retrieve executed SQL commands, which does not store such information. In subsequent responses, the intern continued to suggest incorrect methods, such as using `sqlite_statements`, which also does not store executed commands.

2. **Correctness**: The intern's proposed solutions were not correct. The use of `sqlite_master` and `sqlite_statements` to capture executed SQL commands is incorrect because these tables do not store executed SQL commands. Additionally, the intern did not provide a concrete example of using a SQL proxy or logging library to capture SQL commands.

3. **Completeness**: The intern's responses lacked completeness. While they eventually suggested using SQL proxies or logging libraries, they did not provide a concrete, working example of how to implement these solutions. The intern also failed to address the core issue of capturing SQL commands directly from pandas, which does not expose them.

### Follow-up question

Can you provide a concrete example of using a SQLAlchemy event listener to log SQL commands executed by `df.to_sql()` with `method='multi'`?
